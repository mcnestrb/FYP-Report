As fossil fuels across the world are steadily depleted, the majority of the
world's energy production will shift towards renewable sources. However,
renewable energy sources do not always guarantee the same reliability in rates
of production. Therefore new strategies must be developed to match supply and
demand in the face of unpredictable supply. The growing popularity and
proliferation of smart grid technology is one proposed method of solving this
problem.

In this paper, a network implementation of a game theoretic approach to this
problem is implemented in a smart nanogrid to prove whether or not such an
approach is first feasible in a network, and secondly whether or not it would
provide a better approach to the problem. A number of optimisation techniques,
such as convex optimisation and hyperplane projection optimisation, are also
employed to find a better solution.
