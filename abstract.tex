As fossil fuels across the world are steadily depleted, the majority of the
world's energy production will shift towards renewable sources. However,
renewable energy sources do not always guarantee the same reliability in rates
of production. Therefore new strategies must be developed to match supply and
demand in the face of unpredictable supply. The growing popularity and
proliferation of smart grid technology is one proposed method of solving this
problem.

In this paper, a network implementation of a game theoretic approach to this
problem is implemented in a smart nanogrid to prove whether or not such an
approach is first feasible in a network, and secondly whether or not it would
provide a better approach to the problem. A number of optimisation techniques,
such as convex optimisation and hyperplane projection optimisation, are also
employed to find a better solution. The goal of the project is to find an
implementation that finds a correct solution to the problem as well as as being
able to find it in a short space of time.

Ultimately the method is found to be suitable only in situations involving a
small number of devices within a system. This is due to a problem with
scalability, where the system is slowed down by a large number of network
communications in order to find consensus between the devices taking part in the
system.
